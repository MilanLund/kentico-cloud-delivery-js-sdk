# Delivery SDK for Javascript

## Notification

This is an unofficial SDK for the Kentico Cloud Delivery API. The SDK is currently under development, it is not fully tested and might change without guarantee of backward compatibility.

### Breaking changes

-   (v 0.0.9) It is not possible to request and categorize content in 2 separate steps. This includes: 
    -   In the getContent method the possibility to pass array as the parameter has been removed.
    -   The categorizeContent method is not public anymore.

## About

The purpose of this SDK is to:

-   Deliver complete content for a current view from the Kentico Cloud storage with ease.
-   Simplify the output in order to make it operable for rendering.

All of this happens in a single Promise chain in 3 steps:

1.  Get complete content by calling the `getContent` method that is able to make multiple requests and return a single response.
2.  Simplify the delivered content by getting only values from the complex response with use of the `getValues` method.
3.  Process selected raw values to get them ready to be rendered in a view:
    -   `resolveModularContentInRichText` Rich text elements might contain modular content. This method resolves specified modular content item in specified rich text element according to provided template.

## Installation

```sh
npm install kentico-cloud-delivery-js-sdk
```

## Start

```javascript
var Delivery = require('kentico-cloud-delivery-js-sdk');

// Initialize SDK with Project ID and Preview API Key
var project = new Delivery('28f9fefa0...88bcda2cbd13', 'ew0KICAiYW...iwNCiAgInR5');

// Step 1: Request multiple Kentico Cloud endpoints in one step and get responses categorized by keys of the passing object
project.getContent({
  home: '?system.type=homepage',
  nav: '?system.type=navigation'
})
// Step 2: Get only values from the response and join modular_content values with appropriate data items
.then(project.getValues)
// Step 3: Process values to get them ready to be rendered in a view  
.then(function (data) {
  data = project.resolveModularContentInRichText(data, 'home', 'name_of_rich_text_field', 'codename_of_modular_item', '<div class="template">{elements.label}</div><span>{system.id}</span>');
  return data;
})
// View results
.then(console.log);
```
